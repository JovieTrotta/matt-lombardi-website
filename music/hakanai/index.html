          <h4>Hakanai</h4>
          <p>Hakanai is a band I formed in Brooklyn to mess around with the strictures of traditional songwriting. We generally fall under the vague “indie” umbrella but often dabble in elements of post-rock, math rock, ambient, acoustic, post-hardcore, punk, and chamber pop.</p>

                <p>Abendrot took many years to find its internal voice and come to fruition. What began as loose riffs and ideas eventually amalgamated into a song that goes through many motions across about 8 minutes, hence the splitting into two parts. I wrote the lyrics while ensnared in an unhealthy and vindictive relationship. Escaping this relationship and breaking the cycle of rekindling it was devastating, but allowed me to do a lot of self-reflection. This song means a lot to me in terms of maturation and convalescence, like a tactic in which we seek the silver linings of a stormcloud. This all sounds very melodramatic, but I think it has ended up being the song that I am both proudest of and most nervous about releasing to the world as I've never really written lyrics about such personal matters before.</p>
                <p>For these two songs, I recorded the sessions, playing most of the guitar, bass, piano, and synth parts. Two frequent collaborators, Jake and Peter, played the rhodes and drum parts. I wrote the lyrics and overdubbed the vocals. I then mixed and mastered everything. I took the album photo on film and did the design as well.</p>

                <p>Foundation was originally recorded as layers of simple, looping glitch patterns comprised of guitar played through a strange delay pedal. While contemplating what direction the song should take, whether it was to become ambient, lo-fi, electronic, or full-band, I switched over to bass and tried out a few ideas. Almost unintentionally, I ended up writing a busy, uptempo bass line that seemed to demand equally energetic drums. I brought the track to our drummer Tyler and we came up with a few different rhythms that would play under the looping guitars. Not being able to commit to one groove over the other, we simply decided to use all of them. As a result, the track bounces between rhythmically contrasting sections: switching from a half-time triplet beat to a busier 8th-note groove in the middle of the verse, and vice-versa in the chorus. The drums in the bridge/outro were based on the original bassline, lending itself to a somewhat uptempo Latin groove.</p>
                <p>From there we added some tapping guitar parts, synths, tape loops, auxiliary percussion, mbira, and some vocal samples performed by my friend Alexandra. The lyrics are something of a rumination on urban ennui and its ensuant escapism. To supplement this theme, we filmed a music video in some of the industrial areas of Boston, which I then spliced together into this increasingly frenetic video comprising over 600 individual cuts. It took forever to finish but I think it looks neat.</p>
                <p>For this song, I wrote and played the guitar and bass parts, wrote the lyrics and sang, and recorded the session. Scot Moriarty mixed and mastered it at Backroom Studios in Rockaway, NJ. I took the album photo on film in Osaka and did the design as well. I also filmed and edited the music video.</p>

              <td>
                <p>Woman, Bird, Star is a song that germinated out of this central fingerpicked pattern that I initially wrote years back. I distinctly remember writing it in a quick bout of inspiration upon returning to my apartment after spending a day at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. My girlfriend at the time was particularly struck by this Rodin sculpture, and I got to see some of the works of Miró, whom I’ve always adored. We broke up maybe a year later and I came back to this little idea. I brought it to our drummer Tyler and we riffed on it repeatedly, feeling it out until a structure emerged from within the idea.</p>
                <p>We recorded the instrumentals in single live takes, improvising some parts while striving for that raw band-in-a-room sound. I listened back to the scratch demo over and over, searching for a theme for the lyrics when I vaguely recalled the context in which I’d written the original guitar part. The lyrics and melody then flowed seamlessly into the song, a contented reflection on that day spent in the MFA with someone important to me, and the resultant dolor stemming from the harsh dissolution of love. This song was not originally intended to be released but simply acted as a convenient outlet for convalescence. But we all liked it for its simplicity and figured maybe some other people might too.</p>
                <p>For this song, I wrote and played the guitar parts, wrote the lyrics and sang, recorded the session, then mixed and mastered it. I took the album photo on film in Tokyo and did the design as well.</p>
