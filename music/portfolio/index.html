              <td><p>“Abendrot” is a song I wrote in 2016 that did not progress past the initial stages until I brought it to my drummer friend Peter in early 2020. He convinced me to record and release it, which we did together in the early stages of the global pandemic. The result is a deep and textural indie rock song about the misty synthesis of love and its dissolution.<br>For this song, I recorded and engineered all the parts; played guitar, bass, synth, and piano; wrote the lyrics and sang; mixed and mastered the track; and did the cover design and photography. It acts as a single preceding a full-length album to be released later in 2021</p></td>

              <td><p>I wrote “Wind Raiser” and all the other songs on the album Enenra in the Autumn of 2017 after delving deep into Japanese traditional music and folk tales. With these songs, I embraced the beauty of imperfection; instead of eliminating the poor qualities of my old instruments and shoddy gear, the mixes lean into them as a character quality. I recorded many of the layers using a 4-track cassette machine. No MIDI, digital controllers, virtual instruments, or samples were used. The only work I did with a DAW was the mixing and mastering process.</p></td>

              <td><p>“The Birth of the World” was written while I was still at university as a collaboration with the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. I aimed to combine a love of minimalism and neo-classical with pop elements and rock instrumentation. I recorded the orchestra (two violins, a viola, two cellos, a vibraphone, and glockenspiel) in live takes in the Fenway Center in Boston. I used Northeastern’s Shillman Studio to record my guitar, bass, and piano parts, while my friend Tyler and I then recorded his drums in a foyer, making use of the roomy reverberations of a staircase — Led Zeppelin style — instead of the sterile atmosphere of the recording studio. The lyrics were written only after I’d graduated and moved to Brooklyn, and they discuss a day I spent at a Joan Miró exhibit. This song is from a new band I formed at the beginning of the global pandemic, to debut later in 2021. I mixed and mastered this one as well.</p></td>

              <td><p>“Nocturne In B Flat Minor” is a piece I composed in the autumn and winter of 2015. The piece was written exclusively between midnight and dawn, as I found myself unable to sleep most nights and felt it was cathartic and calming to work while the city around me slept. The nocturne explores romantic and impressionistic sonic elements, delicately balancing lilting melodies, opulent harmony, and calculated yet chaotic fits of rage.<br>This piece was performed by Pei-Yeh Tsai of the Bleep Blop Ensemble at the Fenway Center in Boston, and recorded and mixed by yours truly.</p></td>
