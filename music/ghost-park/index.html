          <h4>Ghost Park</h4>
          <p>Ghost Park is a personal solo project. At university, I majored in Music Recording and minored in Japanese Language and Cultural Studies. As such, this project is my best attempt at merging these two fields of study. In terms of sound, Ghost Park is an experimental mix of acoustic, ambient, minimalist, neoclassical, jazz, and world music.</p>

                <p>Mononoke is the second Ghost Park album named after a spirit from Japanese folklore. I wrote and recorded it in the Autumn and Winter of 2017 after getting out of a draining relationship. The process of creation was very cathartic for me at this time. I recorded many of the acoustic guitar parts in the forest with a portable tape recorder. This is a selection of some of my favorite songs from the album.</p>
                <p>“Malady and Melody” is the album opener, a piece that grows in instrumentation from an initial single acoustic guitar part to include a 40-voice choir, glass percussion, vibraphone, grand piano, distorted guitar, drums, and back to acoustic guitar over its 8 minute span. It’s a weird and creepy song and I enjoy it.</p>
                <p>“Samüm” is a calm respite from the chaos of the previous track, layering several improvisations of hang drum with reversed acoustic guitar and a meandering mandolin. This for some reason is my most popular song.</p>
                <p>“The Remains of Memories” is a slow-burning progression of dense, creepy chords on an out of tune grand piano. The second half is a jazzy, atonal improvisation with my friend Zach on cornet and myself on piano. It was a fun one.</p>
                <p>For this album, I wrote and recorded all the songs and all the parts, with the occasional collaborator stepping in here and there. We used as much analog gear as possible. I also mixed and mastered the entire album.</p>

                <p>Enenra is the first Ghost Park album named after a spirit from Japanese folklore. I wrote it in the Autumn of 2016. It marked my first foray into atypical song structure and writing music in a style of pure expressionism, devoid of direct influence.</p>
                <p>“Wind Raiser” was recorded by the ocean where I was living at the time. I later overdubbed layers of hand percussion and upright piano to join the acoustic guitars.</p>
                <p>“Depths of Winter” is a bit more conventionally structured, with clear A and B sections. Two intertwining acoustic guitar are accompanied by processed electric guitar, electric piano, and hand drums.</p>
                <p>This album was recorded as analog as my limited gear and budget would allow. I performed every sound heard. I also mixed and mastered the album.</p>
