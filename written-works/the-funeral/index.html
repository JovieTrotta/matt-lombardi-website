          <p>poem<br>Aug 13 - Written By Matt Lombardi</p>
          <h4>The Funeral</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="full-width">
          <p>after the funeral.<br>
            we walked abstractedly.<br>
            tracing arcs through the graveyard's grids.<br>
            short bursts of frozen, wintry wind.<br>
            threaded their way through the power lines.<br>
            crossing, silhouetted overhead.<br>
            like so many cracks in the eggshell sky.<br>
            I felt a dark pitch hovering over us.<br>
            threating to spill.<br>
            a canvas of woe.<br>
            upon our mournful troupe.<br>
            I saw a clenched fist in the distance.<br>
            and then I heard the wind whistle your name.<br>
            once, twice.<br>
            too many times to be imagined.<br>
            or hallucinatory.<br>
            a voice.<br>
            finding these fragile bodies, as one.<br>
            all the more distant yet.<br>
            in the spaces that opened up between us as we walked.<br>
            it was perhaps hopeless.<br>
            that eventually this fist — still distant.<br>
            would unclench.<br>
            that these spaces would become.<br>
            solid.<br>
            and black.<br>
            and vitreous.<br>
            and monolithic.<br>
            like sheer menhirs of obsidian.<br>
            but reassured, we mourned as one.<br>
            a body, as one.<br>
            but mind, yet solitary.<br>
            now.<br>
            as one last fragment of frost.<br>
            a winter you endured as a child.<br>
            fades to warmth.<br>
            it fades as memory does.<br>
            lost in naïve thought.<br>
            the empty space between us once again.<br>
            widens and becomes a barrier.<br>
            a blockade.<br>
            materializes with memories.<br>
            petrified.<br>
            on the other side of time.<br>
            you sink deeper into the earth.<br>
            and flowers gnaw at your skin.<br>
            while I am torn.<br>
            from the cemetery path.<br>
            into the sky.<br>
            by a frightful force.<br>
            of god or demon, it matters not.</p>
